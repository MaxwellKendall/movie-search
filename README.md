## Movie Search Application Integrating with Open Movie Database API
- Completed in ~6/7 hours
- Custom CSS with SASS
- Responsive to Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop view ports
- ES6, React, Redux
- Webpack configuration for both development and Production
- Use of Promises with error handling
- Displays details
## FWIW 
- Short project, development time includes configuration, deployment, etc...
- Definitely needs some TLC for styles, other items on my portfolio demonstrate competency with completely custom CSS; for example:
  - https://maxwellkendall.github.io/wack-a-mole-with-build-step/
  - https://maxwellkendall.github.io/book-explorer/
  - https://maxwellkendall.github.io/Web-Dashboard/
## Known Issues
